## Studying

### Courses

* [MIT OCW Economics](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/) - Over 100 courses covering all major fields of econocmics. Courses include prerequisites, recommended textbooks, lecture slides, and assignments. Undergraduate and graduate programs.
* [edX Economics](https://www.edx.org/course/subject/economics-finance) - Introductory topics, few prerequisites.
* [Khan Academy: Economics](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain) - Elementary topics.

### Useful Materials

* [Academic Search](https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=002720237717066476899:e55ib8o11ka) - Search across `.edu` and other educational domains. These materials are more reliable than the big Internet.
* [Foundational Equations of Economics](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/35/what-are-the-foundational-equations-of-economics) - These equations show principles behind "thinking like an economist". Graduate textbooks put these equiations in context.
* [IGM Economic Experts Panel](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel) - Top economists reflect on policy-related issues. Some answers contain useful details.
* [AEA Resources for Economists](http://rfe.org/) - A list of useful links maintained by the American Economic Association.


## Research

### Portals

* [RePEc](http://repec.org/) - Web services for economic researchers: bibliography, blog aggregator, new working papers, software.
* [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis: Web Services](https://research.stlouisfed.org/resources.html) - A list of helpful services.

### Articles and Working Papers

* [IDEAS RePEc](https://ideas.repec.org/) - The largest database of economics publications (2,000,000 items). Searching through papers is easier with Google: ``site:ideas.repec.org <search term>``. Index sources mentioned below.
* [NBER](http://nber.org/papers.html) - Working papers by major researchers. Many of these papers get published in peer-reviewed journal.
* [SSRN Economics](http://ssrn.com/en/index.cfm/ern/) - Working papers, no journal publications.
* [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) - Searching academic literature in general. Features author pages and citation counters. If you look for economic writings only, IDEAS would be more powerful.

### Data

Datasets

* [FRED2](https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/) - 380,000 (macro) time series from 80 sources. Supports plugins for importing data into Excel, Stata, R, and others. Has a mobile app.
* [World Bank Data](http://data.worldbank.org/) - International macro time series. Has data import plugins.
* [IMF Data](http://www.imf.org/en/Data) - The standard reference for macro data.
* [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) - Aggregate financial and economic data from multiple sources. Some data vendors sell their data via this service. Good integration with statistical software.
* [MEDevEcon](https://sites.google.com/site/medevecon/development-economics/devecondata) - Data related to development economics.
* [Monetary Economics: Data Sources](https://sites.google.com/site/davesmant/various/data-sets-sources) - Overview of macro data sources.
* [OFFSTATS](http://www.offstats.auckland.ac.nz/) - Links to official data sources by country and subject.

Search

* [International Open Government Dataset Search](https://logd.tw.rpi.edu//node/9903) - Over 1,000,000 government datasets. When works, this service looks [like this](http://web.archive.org/web/20140815054106/http://logd.tw.rpi.edu/node/9903). Otherwise, you'll see a 403 error.
* [Dataset Search Engine](https://cse.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=002720237717066476899:v2wv26idk7m) - Google-based search over 200 data sources, including those mentioned here. You can use Google [search operators](http://www.googleguide.com/advanced_operators_reference.html) here.
* [StackExchange Open Data](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/) - If you haven't found the data you were looking for, you can ask it here.
* [Reddit /r/datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets) - One more place to request datasets.

### Software

Writing

* [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) - Economists write in LaTeX because it handles mathematics and references better than Word or LibreOffice. If you write regularly, LaTeX is worth learning.
  - [Beamer](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/beamer?lang=en) - A LaTeX class for presentations.
  - [TikZ](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/) - An extension for drawing graphs. A [how-to](http://cremeronline.com/LaTeX/minimaltikz.pdf) and a [manual](http://www.texample.net/media/pgf/builds/pgfmanualCVS2012-11-04.pdf).
* [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/) - A free and simple editor for LaTeX.
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) - Bibliography management. Also install (a) Zotero browser plugin to import papers from RePEc to your library; (b) Zotero-LyX plugin to cite literature easily.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - A version control system. Useful if you want to revert changes done months ago or collaborate with other authors. DropBox also has version control, but Git is more explicit. A [short intro](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). Or use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you like it simple.

Computing

* [Stata](http://www.stata.com/) - An industry standard for statistical computations in economics. Free alternatives:
  - [IPython](http://ipython.org/) - A Python-based environment. Econometric analysis requires SciPy, NumPy, statsmodels, and some other libraries installed. Consider installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), which contains much of the needed stuff.
  - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) - A R-based environment. Many statistical R libraries are not available in other languages, so it's a pretty rich platform.
* [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) - An industry standard for modeling and numerical optimization in economics. Free alternatives:
  - [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
* [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) - Symbolic computations. Free alternative
  - [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/)

Sharing

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - A repository for code and data. Publishing research here is not a common practice, but it's more convenient that alternatives (university home page, DropBox, etc.).
  - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - Simple static websites.
  - [GitHub LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) - Large file storage.
* [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/) - An interactive alternative to LaTeX and Word. See examples how notebooks look like in [data-science-ipython-notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks) and [the gallery](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks).

Reviews

* [Most common programs used by Economists](http://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/5853/most-common-programs-used-by-economists) - A community-managed list of common software.
* [Software for Researchers: New Data and Applications](https://antontarasenko.com/2016/01/14/software-for-research/) - Covers software mentioned above and some more.
